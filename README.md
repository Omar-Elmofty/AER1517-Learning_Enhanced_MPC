## Requirements 
[CVXOPT](https://cvxopt.org/)
[Keras](https://keras.io/)
[ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic)
Preferable environment: Ubuntu 16.04

## Simulator Environment Setup
To setup the simulator environment, please follow the simulator setup instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12NddcTXf4h5ht1D1IKoDDKIvNOBbi42d)
After the simulator is setup, perform the following:
`$ cd ~/aer1217/labs/src`
Remove the existing `aer1217_ardrone_simulator` package, and replace it with the package in this repository
`$ cd ~/aer1217/labs`
`$ catkin_make`

Consult [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/Documentation) if you encounter any issues setting up the package

## Running FMPC

To run FMPC, use the following command:
`$ roslaunch aer1217_ardrone_simulator ardrone_simulator.launch` 
To run using the DNN output, change the flag (self.with_DNN) in `MPC.py` line 51 to True 
(`MPC.py` is located under `~/aer1217/labs/src/aer1217_ardrone_simulator/scripts`)


## Training the DNN
To record training data while running FMPC, run this command in separate terminal
`$ rosbag record /aer1217/learning_state /aer1217/learning_input`

To compile the training data:
`$ cd ~/aer1217/labs/src/aer1217_ardrone_simulator/DNN`
`$ rosrun aer1217_ardrone_simulator compile_training_data.py`
In a separate terminal
`$ rosbag play <bag file recorded>`

To train the DNN: 
`$ cd ~/aer1217/labs/src/aer1217_ardrone_simulator/DNN`
`$ python dnn_train.py`
